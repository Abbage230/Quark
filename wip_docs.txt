=====================

crate - Can hold up to %d items, regardless of their stack size. Not that great for bulk storage, but fantastic for unstackables or a large variety of random items.

piston and sticky_piston 
- Can now push complex blocks (aka Tile Entities), except Monster Spawners.
- Try Sturdy Stone if you need an immovable block for a machine.
- The max amount of blocks that can be moved has also been changed to %d.

beacon
- The beacon beam can be redirected with %s by placing it in the beam's path. Note that the final one must always face towards the sky, and that the beam has a limited horizontal distance it can cover.
- Amethyst
- Corundum

amethyst_cluster - Can redirect Beacon beams. Check the Beacon item for info.


compass
- Can work in other dimensions, pointing towards the entrance portal.
- Must be crafted before it does anything to prevent funny recipe book cheese.

ladders
- Can be right clicked onto another ladder to drop it down.
- As long as there's a structurally sound one behind it, can stand without any blocks behind.
- Looking down while on a ladder will make you descend faster.
- Opening your inventory while a ladder will automatically make you sneak.

corundum_clusters 
- Grows alongside the respective Corundum, either naturally spawned or when left to grow.
- Can redirect Beacom beams, check the Beacon item for info.

myalite_crystals 
- Can be found in Spiral Spires in the outer end. When an Enderman or player using an Ender Pearl teleports adjacent to multiple of these in a line, they'll end up at the other end of the line instead. Forks work, but loops will not.
- Can be grown by placing it under growing Corundum blocks.

pipe 
- Will move items put in with a Hopper/Dropper or equivalent, or via dropped item form on an edge. Items will prefer to fall down, then fowards, then randomly sideways, and only then upwards. 
- Items going into a full container will turn back. Any pipe can be disabled with a Redstone singal, and the amount of items in a Pipe can be read with a Comparator. Pipes with over 16 items will break.

magnet
- Can push and pull any blocks made of Copper or Iron when powered, depending on the side. If multiple magnets are moving the same block, the biggest force will win. A magnet's force on a block is the restone signal it's given minus the distance to the block.
- Hoppers moved with a Magnet will drop one item in front for each block moved. If the item is a seed, it'll try to plant it instead. Stonecutters moved with a Magnet will try to break the block above them.

enchanting_table
- Enchanting now uses a new "Matrix Enchanting" system. Pieces can be generated with Lapis and XP and placed onto a grid. Two pieces of the same type can be merged to upgrade the piece's level. Candles may be used to increase the odds of specific enchantments. Additionally, the Enchanting Table can now hold onto your item and the Lapis in it, hurray!
